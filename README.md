# ADR-Training
Palindrome and Even Number Checker

## Objective
The main goal of this exercise is to practice basic git operations such as forking, branching, merging, resolving merge conflicts, pulling, and committing. You will start with a simple Python script that checks if a number is a palindrome and then later modify it to also check if the number is even.

## Setup
1. **Create a folder** on your local machine called "ADR-Practice" and cd into the folder.
2. **Clone this repository** to your local machine using Terminal and open in Visual Studio Code.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Palindrome Checker (Initial Task)
Write an initial code in a file named `palindrome_checker_YOURNAME.py` which checks if a given number is a palindrome. Replace YOURNAME with your name.

### Task 2: Implement Even Number Check
1. Create a new branch named `feature-even-check_YOURNAME`. Replace YOURNAME with your name.
2. Modify `palindrome_checker_YOURNAME.py` to check if the number is both a palindrome and an even number.
3. Try merging the two branches. This will and should result in a merge conflict. Try resolving it.
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message. (Very Important)
5. Push the changes to your forked repository.

## Pull Request
After you have completed the modification:
1. Create a pull request to the original repository with your changes.
2. Ensure your pull request description clearly describes your modifications.

## Conflict Resolution Exercise
- The tech lead can introduce changes to the `main` branch after some team members have created their pull requests but before merging them.
- This will simulate a real-world scenario where team members must **pull the latest changes** from the main repository, **resolve any merge conflicts**, and **update their pull requests**.

## Completion
Once your pull request has been reviewed and merged by a tech lead, you have successfully completed the exercise.

## Notes
1. Most of you seem to be expereinced developers and I am sure that this would be an easy task for you. We have taken this initiative for those who might not be well acquainted with all essential git operations and need a little introduction before we start working on the actual project.
2. Remember that the main objective is to practice git operations and not the correctness of the actual code. (Essentially make ChatGPT write the code if you want).
3. Ensure you stick to good style and follow the necessary PR rules.
